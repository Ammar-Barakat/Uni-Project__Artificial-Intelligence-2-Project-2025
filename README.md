# Bookhouse: A Book Recommendation System.
 
A machine learning tool to recommend books based on a user’s favorite genres or most-read titles, helping them discover more books that align with their tastes.

## Our Problem: 
Book lovers often have one or two favorite genres or cherished books they keep revisiting, creating a literary comfort zone that inspires them to seek out similar reads.
This comfort zone becomes especially valuable when choosing their next book, helping them avoid spending money on something they might not enjoy.

## Goals: 
1- Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features like title, author & category.

2- Recommendation: Discover the similarity between the books and thefeatures of each user’s favorite books, to recommend the most similar books.

## Technologies Used: 

### Algorithm: Content Based Recommendation System

focuses on analyzing the attributes of items to make personalized suggestions for users. It uses the premise that if a user likes a particular item, they will likely enjoy other items with similar characteristics.
